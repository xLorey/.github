# xLorey🌌

**xLorey** is a team of enthusiastic developers who are passionate about what they love 🛠️

We learn, make mistakes, write our own projects, mods and plugins. 
We do not stop at one thing, we develop in many areas and try to make the world a better place! 💫

“Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid
or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.”
— Linus Torvalds
